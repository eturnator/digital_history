        <h3>Why Ketamine?</h3>
        <p>
            When presented with a number of options to begin the first exploration on drugs, I asked my wife who worked in psychiatric ERs for about a decade now, which one would she pick? After I read the options, she immediately said without hesitation: "Ketamine!". OK then. Ketamine it is.
        </p>
        <h3> What do Users Report About Ketamine?</h3>
        <p>
            Browsing the site <a href="https://www.erowid.org/"> Erowid.org </a> came accross interesting accounts from folks who used this "sedative" drug which is known to have been used in the past as a "tranquilizer for horses". This image from Wikipedia refers to the veterinarian-related aspect of this drug: <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Just_Say_Neigh_%287909762236%29.jpg/159px-Just_Say_Neigh_%287909762236%29.jpg" alt="Ketamine-Just Say Neigh"></img>
        </p>
        <p>
            The experiences under the influence of Ketamine have some common characteristics: <ul> <li>The feeling of being disassociated from one's body even though one is able to observe the external events.</li>
            <li> As the drug becomes absorbed the feeling of a "spin" or a "vertigo effect", or going through a "k-hole" via a bodily vibration, by one user described as going through a "cosmic washing machine." This spin or vibration is not only a sensation it is an event apparent also to the outside observer as in an epileptic shock. </li></ul> </p>
        <p>
            Some people report the experience as feeling dead in the body ("I 100% believed I was dead"), and unpleasant overall, whereas other people report relief from anxiety ("I find stressful topics to be approachable with slow logical thoughts and conversation."), relaxation ("The most important take away was the simple relaxation to let things go. Let it ALL go."). Or even feeling like after going through the vibration or the k-hole effect one is reborn: "I am weeping. My nose is streaming. I have been reborn." (All of the references are from <a href=https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine.shtml> Ketamine on Erowid.org </a>)        
        </p>
           <h3> A Brief Note on How Ketamine Works </h3>
        <p> Ketamine blocks the NMBDA receptor. "NMDA receptors are proteins that control electrical impulses in the brain. 
            Their functions are critical for judgment, perception of reality, human interaction, the formation and retrieval 
            of memory and the control of unconscious activities (such as breathing, swallowing, etc.), also known as autonomic functions." 
            See: <a href:"https://www.tmc.edu/news/2017/03/misdiagnosed/"> TMC News</a> It must be because of these reasons that Ketamine is also known as
            a "party drug", which could be a euphemism for a "date-rape" drug.
        </p>
        
        <h3> What have I Learned from <a href= "https://calib.ro/pronoia/">Visualizing Erowid</a>? </h3>
        
        <p>Close reading does not allow for the broad statistical view that one gets from the information on the site. Distant reading is an apparatus
            much more suitable for "context setting" than close reading is. For example, the gender distribution of the authors who have contributed to the
            Erowid database, the bigram counts of other drugs that are mentioned in close proximty to Ketamine 
            (Nitrous Oxide, Dance Floor, and White Powder respectively). The visualizations also open up questions questions pregnant for 
            further investigation. For example it would be intresting to further investigate the spikes in use of Ketamine between 2000-2014 as shown
            in the "Total Occurances per Substance" graphic.
            Overall Ketamine dosages --if my interpretation is accurate-- above the median dosages for other drugs. One would need to investigate 
            the relationship between dosage and weight of users to find out the effective dosage and dosages that are above what can be considered "normal".
            It seems like users often take the Ketamine in combination with other drugs.            
       </p>    

        <p>
            I think that it would be important to record the location of users as there might be some correlation between the usage of certain drugs
            and their availability in certain regions.
